PFB, 

To be considered:

1/ State Management Approach - Include Context API Zustand/Recoil as good alternative though Redux comes first.
2/ In Styling - Include Post CSS & BEM  

a/ Why PostCSS? – Brief on modern CSS authoring and build-time transformation.
b/ Tooling – How PostCSS fits into modern build tools.
c/ Hands-on Demo – Modify PostCSS config, use nesting and autoprefixer.
d/ Comparison – When to use PostCSS vs. SCSS/Styled Components.

3/ Testing Tools - Vitest can be included

4/ Error Boundaries and Handling

5/ Code Quality - Touch on ESLint, Prettier, and basic folder structure best practices.

6/ Routing Module - Explicitly list React Router v6+ in the curriculum. It’s a core part of any React app.

7/ Accessibility (a11y) - Consider adding a small module or checkpoint to touch on semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and keyboard navigation.

8/ Dev Tools Familiarity - Include React Developer Tools and Redux DevTools in early modules. 


Thank you!
